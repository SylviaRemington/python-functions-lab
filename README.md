# Functions Lab
### Exercise
In this lab, you’ll get hands-on practice defining and calling functions in Python. By the end, you will be able to:

- Understand and apply Python’s function syntax.
- Return values from functions based on given parameters.
- Manipulate simple data types through function parameters.

We understand that some of the exercises in this lab may seem very basic or even easy. This simplicity is intentional. The primary goal is to provide ample opportunity to practice writing Python functions. By focusing on repetition, you can become more comfortable with the syntax and mechanics of function definition and calling.

### Getting Started

- For each exercise, copy the provided code into a new Python script file named exercises.py.
- Follow the exercise instructions carefully to complete the function definitions.
- After completing each exercise, run python3 exercises.py in your terminal to test your code and see the output.

Let’s dive in and start coding!
